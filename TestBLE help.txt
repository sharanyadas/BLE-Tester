Project goal 
============
1. Create a Python application (tkinter GUI is fine) that can connect from 
   laptop's bluetooth (Bluetooth 4.0 or above) and read the device ID of nearby Petasense Mote
2. The App should automatically connect to device labeled "Petasense Mote" with lowest RSSI,
   read device ID, and be able to send the Bluetooth module an SSID and Password

Solution:
=========
From windows machine or MacBook I could not get any of the following tools (e.g. gatttool, hcitool etc) working.
Then I created an Ubuntu VM in a Windows machine and from that VM the Bluetooth device appeared as a USB
interface which was internally mapped to Windows Bluetooth. 


Mainly 3 different tools were used:
===================================
1. hcitool
2. gatttool
3. bluetoothctl

VM:
===
Download Virtual box and install [ VirtualBox-5.2.12-122591-Win]
Download Ububntu ISO file [ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64]
Create VM
Select VDI
Normal Start
Do the network etc settings
Setting-->Storage-->Disk .. click on small round icon and select the [ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64]
Now install Ubuntu

Python:
======
Install Python 2.7
Install PyCharm

#DEBUGGING NOTE :
=================
#    Sometimes I observed that the hcitool, gatttool, bluetoothctl tools did not work and failedee
#    to connect! By searching internet I found some tricks that workd...
#        1. From VM Menu toggle (unselect/select) Device-->USB-->Line on Technology 
#        2. If #1 does not work... from console I did the following:
#           $hciconfig hci0 down
#           $hciconfig hci0 up
#        3. When #2 also failed... I went to Windows bluetooth config and disabled/reenabled it.

Other SW that I installed for experiemnt:
=========================================

Read http://christopherpeplin.com/2015/10/22/pygatt-python-bluetooth-low-energy-ble/ and https://github.com/peplin/pygatt
Download pygatt
set path:
  System-->Advance setting--> System Env variable--> edit "path" and add c:\Python27
Download and Install pip
  Go to https://dev.to/el_joft/installing-pip-on-windows
  Download C:\Users\sharanya\Downloads\get-pip.py
  Run "python C:\Users\sharanya\Downloads\get-pip.py" from CMD prompt


$apt-cache search pygatt
$apt-cache search bluez
$sudo apt-get install bluez
$dmesg
$hcitool
$sudo apt-get install python-pexpect
https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules/how-to-use-the-pexpect-module-in-python/


hcitool and gattool commands
============================
$sudo hcitol lescan  #scan BLE devices. Only the hcitool command options with le prefix will work for BLE device
$hcitool leinfo <MAC>

$gattool -I
[...][LE]> connect <MAC>
connection successful
[... MAC...>[LE] 
$gatttool -b <MAC> -l  #Connect to a BLE device
switch <MAC> with MAC of Mote and then play with gattool

Note:
- if connection problem.. try enable disable the BLE of VM from VM UI Device-->USB-->Lite on Technology Corp
- OR do this..
    $hciconfig hci0 down
    $hciconfig hci0 up
